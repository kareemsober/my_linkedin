 We present a co-design study that explores
 the concept of customization for glucose monitors
 0:00:08.460,0:00:10.160
 to support everyday care.
 0:00:10.160,0:00:14.950
 We conducted brainstorming sessions and identified
 challenges with current monitors including
 0:00:14.950,0:00:18.360
 portability, feedback, and privacy-related
 issues.
 0:00:18.360,0:00:22.670
 Informed by the study, we built a simple design
 probe, DiaFit, consisting of multiple modular
 0:00:22.670,0:00:27.060
 accessories and feedback modules that can
 be assembled and worn on various body parts
 0:00:27.060,0:00:29.210
 to monitor glucose levels.
 0:00:29.210,0:00:34.230
 Here you can see how DiaFit can be customized
 on various accessories with different feedback
 0:00:34.230,0:00:37.576
 modules, and how these modules work.
 0:01:43.268,0:01:46.918
 We invited participants to try DiaFit and
 share insights.
